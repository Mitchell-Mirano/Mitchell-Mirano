### Mitchell
___
Hi I'm Mitchell, I'm 23 years old and I'm from Peru.
I am currently studying Computer Science and I have studied Data Science at Platzi.
Someday every Data Scientist needs to take their models to production or just automate their processes, that's why I complemented my learning by learning Backend Development with Python and cloud services like GCP.

I love Python, but it may not be so good for some tasks or in any case it needs other technologies to be useful. That's why I'm always willing to learn new technologies.
